# Sudoku

This program was developed using Python. Using a backtracking algorithm and recursion, this program receives a partially filled Sudoku puzzle via API call and solves it in the minimum number of attempts. The program allows the user to select a difficulty level and can also display the puzzle as it is being solved.
